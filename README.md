# Basic-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Trying to use monte carlo simulation with brownian motion stock prices top construct a 3 stock portfolio of META NVDA and the Index SOXL with a caveat of also having long option calls on the VIX to interact with tail risk (IE market blowing up during portfolio construction) did not use mean variance optimization either, very simple and basic.
